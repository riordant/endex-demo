# üîÆ Future Plans

## Road to Decentralization

Integrating FHE into a blockchain-runtime is a hard and complex task. Our engineering philosophy is _Ship Fast_, and we believe that to build the best possible product we need to meet real users early. Similar to the approach described in [Vitalik's "training wheels" post](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) (in the context of rollups), we too are relying on "training wheels" releasing CoFHE to achieve this goal.

Outlined here is a non-exhaustive list of trust-points, centralized components and compromises made to ship CoFHE to users as fast as possible, along with how we plan to address them in the future. This list will be updated as things progress.

| Component              | Compromise                                                   | Plan to solve                                                                    | Timeline | Status |
