# Decryption Request Flow

The process of requesting decryption through Smart Contracts starts the same as every other [FHE Operation Request](fhe-operation.md) ðŸ“Œsteps 1-4 \
Here we'll continue from FheOS server handling such request as follows:
### Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the complete flow of an FHE Decryption request in the CoFHE ecosystem:

### ðŸ“Œ Step 5: FheOS server - Decryption Execution
The FheOS server handles decryption requests:

1. **Create execution thread** on the fheOS server

2. **FheOS server calls the threshold network** with:
   - The ciphertext to be decrypted
   - Transaction hash from the host chain
   - Original operation handle

### ðŸ“Œ Step 6: Threshold network security protocol
   - Verify the host chain requested the desired decryption
   - Retrieve the actual ciphertext hash from private storage
   - Validate ciphertext hash integrity
   - Perform secure decryption

### ðŸ“Œ Step 7: FheOS Notifies the Aggregator with the decrypt result ![Bullet](../../../../static/img/assets/7.png)
   - Call appropriate callback function on the Aggregator 
   - The Aggregator calls the TaskManager with relevant result

### ðŸ“Œ Step 8: TaskManager emit event with decryption result ![Bullet](../../../../static/img/assets/8.png)
   - Provide decrypted result by emitting an event `DecryptionResult` 
   - The event consists of `ciphertext handle`, `result`, `requestor` (of that decrypt operation)
