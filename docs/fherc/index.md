# FHERC Standards Overview

FHERC standards define the specifications and implementations for confidential tokens and smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on the blockchain. These standards ensure interoperability, security, and consistency across different implementations of confidential assets.

## What are FHERC Standards?

FHERC standards are similar to ERC standards in the Ethereum ecosystem but specifically designed for confidential operations. They define:

- How confidential tokens should behave
- Interface requirements for FHE-enabled smart contracts
- Methods for handling encrypted operations
- Standards for maintaining privacy while ensuring functionality

## Key Features

- **Confidential by Default**: All token operations are encrypted by default
- **Homomorphic Operations**: Support for mathematical operations on encrypted data
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Consistent methods across all implementations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Integration with existing blockchain infrastructure
- **Verifiable Privacy**: Cryptographic guarantees for confidential operations
